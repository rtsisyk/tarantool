 * If the callee has yielded, @link fiber_resume @endlink resumes it from a

 * the control to its caller only in the next three cases:
 *  a) By invoking @link fiber_yield @endlink
 *  b) On cancel
 *  c) On finish
 * In all other cases the control is returned to the scheduler, but the fiber
 * stays attached to its caller. Only @link fiber_resume @endlink and

 *
 * A "detached" fiber loses the connection with its caller and always returns
 * back to the scheduler. The method @link fiber_detach @endlink can be used to
 * change the caller of a fiber to "sched". If an attached fiber has invoked
 * @link fiber_detach @endlink, the control IS NOT tranferred, but an original
 * caller will be woken up later by the scheduler. If a fiber is detached then
 * @link fiber_resume @endlink will change the caller value and attach
 * the callee fiber.
 *
 * An attempt to call @link fiber_resume @endlink on an attached fiber from
 * a different caller IS NOT supported intentionally. Please use
 * @link fiber_wakeup @endlink to implement such recursive logic.
 *
 * This method transfers control. This is a cancellation point.
